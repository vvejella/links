Jumping off a platform the height of a three-story building is how Olympian Laura Wilkinson broke her fear.

Staring at an intimidating 33-foot drop, adrenaline pumping, Wilkinson flipped gracefully into the water below. The challenges she has overcome throughout her diving career have made her strong -- strong enough to dominate the sport for a decade.
She is the first woman to win diving's three major world titles, including a gold medal at her first Olympic Games in 2000. Wilkinson told CNN she is hungry for more. After nine years in retirement, and recovery from a dangerous injury, the now 42-year-old is attempting a comeback in the face of a worldwide pandemic.
When Wilkinson resumed training to compete at the Games in Tokyo, which were originally scheduled for July 2020, she felt a nagging and unfamiliar weakness in one of her arms.
An MRI revealed major damage to the discs in her neck, caused in large part by a career of repeatedly hitting the water at high speeds. Her doctor warned that a car accident or bad fall could leave her a quadriplegic.
Now married with four children, Wilkinson was told she would need spinal surgery not just to dive, but to safely do everyday activities with her children. Wilkinson had the surgery and rushed to get back into the water ahead of the 2020 Olympic trials.
